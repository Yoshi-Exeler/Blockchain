Decentralized Blockchain Propagation Protocol

Relays can have a file specifying other relays that they should connect to
Relays keep a local copy of the Blockchain
Relays accept new blocks and propagate them to every node they know
Proto: NEW_BLOCK, block 
    -> BLOCK_OK
    -> BLOCK_REJECTED
Relays accept new transactions and propagate them to every node they know
Proto: NEW_TX, transaction
    -> TX_OK
    -> TX_REJECTED
Relays must allow consumers to sync their Blockchain
Proto: SYNC, LastBlockHash
    -> SYNC_STATE_OK // sent when there is nothing to sync
    -> SNYC_NEXT_BLOCKS, []blocks // returns all blocks the consumer needs up to a maximum value
    -> SNYC_BC_INVALID // sent when one of the hashes is unknown to the node
Relays must allow consumers to initialize their Blockchain
Proto: INIT, safetyValue
    -> INIT_Blocks, [safetyValue]Blocks
